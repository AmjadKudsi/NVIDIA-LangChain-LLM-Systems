    "- Develop your prompts iteratively. Start simple, try zero-shot CoT when you think it might be helpful, and expand to use more verbose example-based CoT prompting when the need arises.\n",
    "- Consider the use of external, non-LLM tools for tasks that LLMs may not be well-suited for (like math). We are going to look at tool use later in the workshop but the general idea is that LLMs are incredible, but not necessarily for every single task. Reflect if you will on the case of long multiplication about how fast, reliable, and effective simple Python is. Don't fall into the old adage _\"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\"_ LLMs are only one of your many tools to use while building LLM-based applications."
