# NVIDIA NIM LangChain Prompting and Agents
This repository is a structured, end to end walkthrough of building large language model applications using NVIDIA NIMs as the inference backbone and LangChain as the orchestration layer. It progresses from basic prompt submission to fully agentic systems, demonstrating how NIM-hosted models can be accessed programmatically and composed into reliable, reusable workflows suitable for production-grade experimentation and application development.

The early sections establish fundamentals of prompt engineering with NIM served chat models, covering direct prompt response cycles, streaming, and batch execution. LangChain is introduced as the primary abstraction layer, enabling standardized interaction with NIM endpoints while reducing boilerplate and improving composability. This grounds the reader in how NIMs fit into a modern LLM stack as high performance, containerized model services optimized for low latency inference.

The core of the repository centers on LangChain Expression Language and runnables, showing how discrete units of work can be chained, parallelized, and reused. These chains illustrate how NIM-powered models can be embedded into larger data flows, enabling scalable prompt pipelines rather than single-shot interactions. Message based prompting expands this capability by leveraging system, human, and AI roles to implement few shot prompting, controlled personas, and chain of thought style reasoning, all while remaining compatible with NIM deployed chat models.

Later sections focus on structured output and tool integration. Pydantic is used to enforce schema-validated model responses, enabling reliable data extraction and tagging from unstructured text. Tool use and agents demonstrate how NIM-backed LLMs can reason about when to invoke external functions and incorporate their outputs into final responses. This highlights NIM's role as the reasoning engine within agentic systems, while LangChain manages control flow and integration logic.

Overall, the repository presents a complete, practical blueprint for building prompt driven, structured, and agentic LLM applications using NVIDIA NIMs and LangChain. It emphasizes modular design, iterative prompt refinement, and production-oriented patterns that extend beyond simple text generation into full LLM-powered systems.
