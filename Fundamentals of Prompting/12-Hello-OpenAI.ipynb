    "The `chat.completions` endpoint is designed to handle multi-turn conversations, keeping track of the context provided by previous messages. It generates more concise, focused responses by anticipating a back-and-forth interaction, even if only a single prompt is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `completions` endpoint is designed for generating a response to a single prompt without maintaining conversational context. It aims to complete the prompt that was given to it, rather than respond to it conversationally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway is that when working with \"chat\" or \"instruction\" models (like the llama-3.1-8b-instruct model you are working with today), use `chat.completions` and not `completions`."
